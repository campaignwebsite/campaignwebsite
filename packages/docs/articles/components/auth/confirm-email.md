# Confirm email

A component that is shown to users to inform them they should confirm their email address by clicking a link sent to their email. The component typically appears after a user fills out a registration form for an event or group. The text in the component should refer to the action the user just took, and explain that confirming their email is necessary to complete the registration process.

This component should be shown in the form of a dialog.
