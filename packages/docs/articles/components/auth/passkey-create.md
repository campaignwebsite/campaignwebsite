# Passkey create

A component that allows users to create a passkey for authentication. This component is shown after a user has provided their email address during the signup process, signed in by confirming their email address, and no passkey is currently associated with that email address.

Only users who want to become a Super Admin, Event Organizer or Group Organizer will be prompted to create a passkey during signup. Regular users will not see this component. The component should explain why creating a passkey is important for account security, and nessesary for proceeding with whatever action the user is taking (e.g. creating a new event).

This component should be shown in the form of a dialog.
