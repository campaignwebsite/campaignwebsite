# User: Join Group

## Overview

A user discovers a group and joins it to connect with like-minded people and participate in group activities.

## Prerequisites

- User is authenticated (or will create account during join)
- Group exists and is discoverable
- Group is accepting new members (or join requests)

## User Story

```
As a user
I want to join a group
So that I can connect with others who share my interests
```

## Step-by-Step Flow

   - Sees: Group name, description, member count, recent activity
   - Sees: "Join Group" button (prominent)
   - Can: View group events and posts (if public)

2. User clicks "Join Group" button
   - System checks: User authentication status
   - If not authenticated: Redirects to sign in/register flow

3. System processes join request:
   - If group is open: User joins immediately
   - If group requires approval: Join request created
   - System creates GroupMember record
